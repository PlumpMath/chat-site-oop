# Chat-Site is a chatting app

### Notice

This not a complete project, sesitives was gitignored.  
So i'm afraid you can run it to see it in action.  
I wrote this to try and experience some concepts about OOP.  
Which you can find more here: https://github.com/coffee-js/languages/issues/34  

Anyway I think it's a good attempt. Because I benefited from this.  
I used JS's Objects to simulate Classes. It looks charming.  
Check the `src/handle.ls` which I wrote in LiveScript.  
Also I used my [`live-tmpl`][tmpl] as my template engine.
